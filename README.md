I am a junior developer with a strong education in programming, furthered by my recent partecipation and finalisation of a master's degree in full-stack development. While my previous work experience is focused on the textile sector, i'm now covering a Assistant Tech Lead (Fullstack Ruby on Rails , React). My background demonstrates my ability to adapt to diverse environments and my commitment to continuous learning. I am seeking opportunities that will allow me to grow as a professional and contribute enthusiastically to development projects.
